* INTEL HEX UTILITY - IHDIFF
*
*******************************************************************************/

/*******************************************************************************
* ihDiff.cpp
*
* This utility is designed to compare the content of two Intel HEX format files.
* The utility generates a list of differences between the two chosen files,
* including:
*   - Addresses where two bytes differ from one another
*   - Addresses where one file has content, but the other does not.
* The utility also checks the source file for issues. Regardless of the issues
* potentially found, the utility will do its best to generate a differences
* list.
*

* page at http://codinghead.github.com/Intel-HEX-Class
