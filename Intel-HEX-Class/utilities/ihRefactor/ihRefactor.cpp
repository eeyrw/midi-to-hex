* INTEL HEX UTILITY - IHREFACTOR
*
*******************************************************************************/

/*******************************************************************************
* ihRefactor.cpp
*
* This utility is designed to refactor the content of an Intel HEX file. Often,
* the content of an Intel HEX file is not created in increasing address order
* but in several chunks of address blocks where higher addressed blocks come
* before lower addressed blocks. Occaisionally files can also have a number of 
* Linear/Segment Address Records although the entire file content lies in the 
* same 64kByte segment and requires only a single such record.
* This utility reads the desired hex file into memory and then writes it anew 
* into the desired destination file. The resulting file will be built from the 
* lowest address found in the source file to the highest with the minimum
* number of Linear/Segment Address Records required. 
* The resulting file is, content-wise, the same as the source file. However, 
* examining the content in a text editor should be made easier since the code is
* in the order that it would appear in memory.
* The utility also checks the source file for issues. If any warnings occur, the
* destination will still be created and the warnings will be output to cout.
* If there are any serious issues with the source file, no destination file will
* be created. The errors found will be listed to cout.
*
